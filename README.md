## Zero-Trust-Security-Model

In this project, we implemented several supervised machine learning models to perform classification tasks on our dataset. We started with Logistic Regression, a linear model that predicts class probabilities and works well for linearly separable data. Next, we used the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which classifies data points based on the majority class of their closest neighbors in the feature space. We also applied a Decision Tree Classifier, a tree-based model that splits the data into branches to make predictions and is easy to interpret. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was used for its ability to find the best boundary between classes, especially in complex datasets. Additionally, we included a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a basic neural network capable of learning complex patterns in the data. Finally, we combined these models using a Voting Classifier Ensemble, which improves overall performance by aggregating the predictions of multiple models, making the final output more robust and accurate.
